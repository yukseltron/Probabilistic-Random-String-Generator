Weekly Schedule
---------------

Our group plans to follow an agile development environment to ensure we complete our project cohesively and in a 
timely manner. 

### Weekly Meetings

The first idea we have is to have weekly in-person meetings where we will collaborate on our shared work which will consist of the design, development and testing of our project. These weekly meetings will take place on Thursdays between 3 to 6pm.

### Weekly Conference Calls

The second idea we have is to conference calls every week on Mondays to discuss our progress on the tasks this week. These calls do not have to be too in depth, mostly to touch on any issues that we are facing and to make sure everyone is on the same page for the project. We decided on conference calls because it is much more organized than communicating over text messages.
