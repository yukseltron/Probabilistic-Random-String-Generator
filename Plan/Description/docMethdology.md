## Documentation Methodology

### Report

#### Format

We will be writting a wiki article for the specifications of the grammer generator loosely following the Volere format for software specifications. This is because we feel Volere does a better job at highlighting the most important areas of this project such as the needs, requirements and issues.

#### Sections

Key Sections of the report will be broken down into:

- Needs: Address the goal of the project and what we hope to accomplish. Define the scope and assumptions of the project.
- Requirements: Functional and non-functional requirements to successfully meet our project needs.
- Issues: Issues and roadblocks along the way as well as current remaining issues and future risks to address.
- Definitions: A glossary of terms referenced in the report that is relevant to the project. 

### Code Documentation

Since we will be using python as our language of choice for implementing the generator we will be using Pydocs format to comment the code for clarity. 

### Instructions

The instructions of the grammer generator will be located in the main readme that is stored in the repo of project. This is to make the instructions immedietely available to the user when they first access the repository.
