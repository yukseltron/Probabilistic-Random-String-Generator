Insight to be Gained
--------------------

###### On Grammars and their implementation
The basis for this project involves an understanding of grammars and how they are implemented.
As such, it will involve learning a lot of tools commonly used to express grammars, including python, Go, and Lisp to name a few.
As well, we hope to learn about how to make tools that allow a user to freely express different grammars.    


###### On probability and its implementation
An understanding of probability will also come into play as we try to implement our probability extension on productions.
We should allow for the project to be liberal in how a user wants to express the probability for a production.
As such, programming tools involving the implementation of probability equations will also be learned.  


###### On typing and its compiler implementation
We will also have to make use of well-typing strategies, in order to ensure the program we output maintains well-typing.
To accomplish this we probably will have to learn about compiler design in order to make important decisions on achieving well-typing, while also preserving optimality.
This will provide us with a better understanding of typing, as well as its implementation in softare.


###### On artistry and poetry generation
Since the potential to generate random sentences, it could be a fun to figure out how to support "poetry". This would require learning more about poetry, 
such as its various structures and forms.
