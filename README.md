#### Background
This is our CS 4TB3 Project Repo migrated from GitLab.
After being given a grammar `G` (context-free or context-sensitive), be able to create a random sentence `s`, or a set of sentences `S`,  based off of `G`. However there are two extensions to be added:

‚Ä¢ Add probabilities for alternatives in productions

‚Ä¢ Context information to make the output from the grammar G well-typed


#### Overview
To view the source code, see GrammarTools.py inside of the `src` folder.
To view documentation for the code or the project poster, see GrammarTools.md inside of the `documentation` folder.
To view our plan files, they are invidivdually inside of the `Plan` folder.

However, everything is included in the `proposal.md` file if you rather have it all in one place.


#### Navigation

Inside the `src` folder: 
- GrammarTools.py `source code`
- simple_grammar_test.py `testing on CFG source code`
- CSG_test.py `testing on CSG source code`


Inside the `documentation` folder: 
- GrammarTools markdown #documentation
- 4tb3finalposter pdf #project poster

Inside the `Plan` folder, it will have:

Inside the `Description` folder are the markdown files for:
- research question
- testing methodology
