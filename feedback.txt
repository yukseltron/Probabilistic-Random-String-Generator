Project Proposal: 3/3

Good project, extenstive proposal. However, the proposal does not need to
include details like testing, but should have included a sample grammar
and a sample randomly produced output. Revise the proposal and let me know.

Project Artifacts:

Cleanly designed poster, however, the implementation does not take context
dependencies into account, sentences are generated randomly, so this can't
be used for generating simple programs with typed variables, for example.
It also can't be used to generate natural language sentences where the noun
and verb have to match. I suggest you try to address that.
